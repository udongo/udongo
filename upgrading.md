# Upgrade guide
## From 5.2.0 to 5.3.0
Nothing to see here.


## From 5.1.0 to 5.2.0
This release adds the ```Asset``` and ```Image``` model. If you have one of 
those in your project, you need to delete them and use the ones Udongo provides.

A new config object ```Udongo.config.assets``` has been added. Here you can set
which image/file extensions are allowed.
The following images are allowed by default: gif, jpeg, jpg and png.
The following files are allowed by default: doc, docx, pdf, txt, xls and xlsx.

## From 5.0.1 to 5.1.0
### Users
A user now has an 'active' (boolean) field. If you already have that, you need
to remove it and let it be added by the Udongo migrations after which you
migrate your data.

## From 5.0.0 to 5.0.1
No backwards incompatible changes.

## From 4.0.0 to 5.0.0
# User model
We added a ```User``` model. If your application used to have one, make sure to
use the Udongo one and migrate your data accordingly.

## From 3.0.0 to 4.0.0
No backwards incompatible changes.

## From 2.0.4 to 3.0.0
### Forms
Everything related to the form models has been deleted. So if you use any of 
these classes, you're in for a rough ride.
* Form
* FormDecorator
* FormField
* FormFieldValidation
* FormSubmission
* FormSubmissionData
* FormSubmissionDecorator

### Configuration
You can now choose which breakpoints you want to show in the interface when 
editing flexible content. See the docs.

### BackendController renamed to Backend::BaseController
You need to change each occurence of ```BackendController``` with ```Backend::Basecontroller```

### Spec support/factories
You can now again require spec/support and spec/factories in your specs. This
way you can easily test shared examples eg for translatable.

### I18n configuration
Change every instance of ```Udongo.config.i18n.locales``` with
```Udongo.config.i18n.app.locales``` and ```Udongo.config.i18n.default_locale```
with ```Udongo.config.i18n.app.default_locale```

### Backend default_locale helper renamed
In the backend you used to have a helper ```default_locale```. You need to 
rename each occurence to ```default_app_locale```

### Removed the setting `prefix_with_locale`
Make sure to remove this setting from your Udongo config.
```Udongo.config.routes.prefix_with_locale = true```

### Webserver restart
The button to manually restart the webserver has been removed. If you want to
keep this behaviour, below is the old code.

```ruby
class Backend::WebserverController < Backend::BaseController
  def restart
    `touch tmp/restart.txt`
    redirect_to backend_path, notice: t('b.msg.webserver.restarted')
  end
end
```


### Backend::TranslationForm
This form object was added and can be used to simplify your existing translation
forms (except for those that use SEO). To stay up-to-date, you should check your
translation form objects and if they can benefit from this new class.


## From 2.0.1 to 2.0.4
No actions required.


## From 2.0.0 to 2.0.1
* Reform gem is no longer used. Make sure to add this gem to your gemfile if you
wish to continue using this.


## From 1.0.4 to 2.0.0
### Configuration
Configuration options have been placed in subclasses that are autoloaded. Consult
the documentation about which settings there are.

### Translations
A new nl/en_general.yml file was added which will hold all translations that may
be used both in the frontend and backend.
